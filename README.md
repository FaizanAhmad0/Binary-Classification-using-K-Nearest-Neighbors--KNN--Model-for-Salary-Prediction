# Binary-Classification-using-K-Nearest-Neighbors--KNN--Model-for-Salary-Prediction

Introducing an insightful program that implements binary classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch. The program focuses on predicting whether a salary is greater than 35000 or not, assigning a label of 1 for salaries above 35000 and 0 for salaries below.

The program begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading the salary dataset. It preprocesses the data, ensuring it is appropriately formatted for training and testing the KNN model. 

Next, the program implements the KNN algorithm from scratch, which involves calculating the distances between data points, selecting the K nearest neighbors, and assigning the class label based on the majority vote. The program allows you to define the value of K, enabling customization based on your requirements.

With the trained KNN model, the program proceeds to predict the class labels for the test data. It evaluates the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing insights into the model's effectiveness in binary classification.

The program's output includes the predicted labels for the test data, along with the evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance. It provides a clear understanding of the accuracy and reliability of the KNN model in predicting salary categories based on the given threshold.

This program serves as a valuable tool for salary prediction tasks and binary classification problems. By implementing the KNN algorithm from scratch, it enables you to grasp the inner workings of the model and tailor it to specific scenarios.

Take advantage of this program to dive into the world of binary classification using KNN. Uncover patterns, make accurate predictions, and gain valuable insights into salary categorization based on the specified threshold.

Note: Fine-tuning the KNN model, selecting an optimal value for K, and exploring additional feature engineering techniques can further enhance the program's predictive performance for salary classification tasks.
